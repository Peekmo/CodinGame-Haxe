CodinGame-Haxe
==============

My solutions to CodinGame with Haxe

How does it works ?
==============

Compile into JS, and replace "{INPUT}" and 9999 by *readline()* and console.log by *print*
It's did automatically with sed in build.hxml. Remove the -cmd line if you haven't got 'sed' command.

(Look at JS folder for JS generated and used to validate)
